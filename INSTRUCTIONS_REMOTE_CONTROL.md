## Remote control is not working - nothing happens
*
- Try to unpair it from your phone / computer Bluetooth settings, then re-pair it.
- Try restarting the pairing process in BikeControl
- try restarting Bluetooth on your phone and on the device you want to control
- If your other device is an iOS device, go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > AssistiveTouch > Pointer Devices > Devices and pair your device. Make sure AssistiveTouch is enabled.
- it is very important that both devices (e.g. iPhone and iPad) receive the "pairing dialog" after initial connection. If you miss it, unpair and try again. It may take a few seconds for the dialog to appear. Afterwards you may need to click on "Reconnect" in BikeControl / restart BikeControl.

## Remote control only clicks on a single coordinate on my iPad

iOS seems to be buggy here - try this in the iOS settings:
AssistiveTouch settings > Pointer Devices > Devices > Connected Devices > iPhone (or BikeControl iOS) > Button 1
switch the setting to None, then back to Single-Tap and it should work again
