# Play Store Changelogs

This directory contains release notes for Play Store uploads.

Each changelog file should be named with the version code (e.g., `242.txt` for version 2.4.0+2).

The files should contain the what's new text that will be displayed to users in the Google Play Store when they update the app.

Example:
- `242.txt` - Release notes for version 2.4.0+2
- `243.txt` - Release notes for version 2.4.0+3

Each file should contain plain text describing the changes in that version.
