## What is the Local connection method?
* 
The Local connection method works by directly controlling the target trainer app on the same device by simulating user input (taps, keyboard inputs). This method does not require any network connection or additional hardware, making it the simplest and most straightforward way to connect to the trainer app.

There are predefined keymaps (touch positions or keyboard shortcuts) for popular trainer apps, allowing users to easily set up and start using the Local connection method without needing to configure anything manually. You can configure these keymaps in the Configuration tab. Note though that supported keyboard keys depend on the trainer app.

## When to use the Local connection method?
* 
The Local connection method is ideal for users who:
  - Are running the trainer app on the same device as the controller app (e.g., both apps on a smartphone or tablet).
  - Do not want to deal with network configurations or potential connectivity issues.

## Limitations of the Local connection method
* 
While the Local connection method is easy to set up and use, it has some limitations:
  - It may not work well with trainer apps that have complex user interfaces or require precise timing.
  - It is limited to the device on which both the controller and trainer apps are running, meaning it cannot be used for remote control scenarios.
