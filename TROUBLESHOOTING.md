## Click / Ride device cannot be found
*
This means BikeControl does NOT see the device via Bluetooth.
- Put the controller into pairing mode (LED should blink)
- Ensure the controller is NOT connected to another app/device (e.g. Zwift)
- Update controller firmware in Zwift Companion, if available
- Reboot Bluetooth / reboot phone/PC

## Click / Ride device does not send any data
*
You may need to update the firmware in Zwift Companion app.

## My Click v2 disconnects after a minute or buttons do not work
*

To make your Click V2 work best you should connect it in the Zwift app once before a workout session.
If you don't do that BikeControl will need to reconnect every minute.

1. Open Zwift app (not the Companion)
2. Log in (subscription not required) → device connection screen
3. Connect trainer, then connect Click v2
4. Keep it connected for ~10–30 seconds
5. Close Zwift completely, then connect in BikeControl
