/// Fix-wave-1 (F2): `SensorHub.register` had zero production callers, so
/// `sourcesFor()` was always empty and the entire external-sensor feature was
/// dead in the running app even though the hub itself was fully unit tested.
/// A hub-only test cannot see that kind of gap — it never touches the caller
/// that was missing. This drives a heart rate strap through the REAL
/// `Connection`: scan, classification, connect queue, same as
/// `controller_connection_test.dart`.
///
/// `BleHeartRateDevice.shouldAutoConnect` is false (fix-wave-1 F1: a strap
/// must never be auto-connected), and there is no rider-facing "pair this
/// strap" action yet to drive `device.connect()` through its normal upstream
/// path. So instead of waiting on the connect queue, this connects the fake
/// peripheral directly at the platform level — exactly what a real BLE stack
/// reports regardless of *why* the radio connected. `Connection`'s
/// `connectionStream` listener is already attached the moment the strap
/// enters the connect queue (it runs for every device, auto-connectable or
/// not — see `shouldAutoConnect`'s doc comment), and reacts to that report
/// the same way either way. That listener, and the disconnect path beside it,
/// are exactly the wiring this test exists to prove.
