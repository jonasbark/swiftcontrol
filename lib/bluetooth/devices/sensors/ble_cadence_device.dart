/// Transport only, same shape as `BleHeartRateDevice`: discover, subscribe,
/// and hand bytes to [source]. The source owns parsing — including the
/// two-sample delta CSC cadence needs — and the hub above it owns whether
/// this reading is the one the rider actually wants. No buttons: a cadence
/// sensor has nothing for the rider to click, so it is registered with an
/// empty [availableButtons] like the other non-controller accessories in
/// this directory.
///
/// `with Accessory`: a cadence sensor reacts to nothing and sends nothing a
/// rider binds to a button, same as a strap or a Headwind. Without the
/// mixin, `Connection` remembers it as `RememberedDeviceKind.controller`
/// instead of excluding it the way it does every other accessory, and its
/// settings page renders an empty Button Mapping table.
