/// A standards-compliant BLE power meter (Cycling Power Service) paired
/// directly to BikeControl.
///
/// Transport only, same shape as `BleHeartRateDevice`: discover, subscribe,
/// and hand bytes to [source]. [source] claims both power and cadence — a
/// power meter's crank almost always doubles as a cadence source, and the
/// CPS parser it feeds already extracts both from the same notification. No
/// buttons: a power meter has nothing for the rider to click, so it is
/// registered with an empty [availableButtons] like the other
/// non-controller accessories in this directory.
///
/// `with Accessory`: a power meter reacts to nothing and sends nothing a
/// rider binds to a button, same as a strap or a Headwind. Without the
/// mixin, `Connection` remembers it as `RememberedDeviceKind.controller`
/// instead of excluding it the way it does every other accessory, and its
/// settings page renders an empty Button Mapping table.
///
/// Detection is deliberately narrower than a cadence sensor's: many power
/// meters accept only one simultaneous BLE connection, so
/// `BluetoothDevice.fromScanResult`'s `_ignoredNames` still hides
/// Favero/Quarq/PowerCrank-style meters — known to cause exactly that
/// conflict — unless the rider has opted in via `Settings.getPowerMeterOptIn`.
