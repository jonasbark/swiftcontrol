/// Re-tops the trainer overlay when a trainer app grabs the proxy while the
/// overlay is already on screen.
///
/// The bug this fixes (Android): the overlay is a system window added while
/// BikeControl is in the foreground. When a trainer app such as Rouvy then
/// comes to the foreground, the overlay ends up buried beneath it and stays
/// hidden — the rider sees it over every other app "but only not with Rouvy"
/// (support 73367365) — until the window is re-added. Disabling and re-enabling
/// the overlay fixes it because that re-adds the window; this scheduler
/// automates that re-add at the right moment.
///
/// It watches each proxy's "a trainer app is connected" signal
/// ([ProxyDevice.isConnectedListenable]) and, on the false→true edge, asks the
/// controller to [TrainerOverlayController.reassert]. The call is:
/// - **debounced**, so a flapping DirCon reconnect collapses into one re-top
///   rather than thrashing the window; and
/// - **gated** on the overlay being both enabled and currently showing, so a
///   trainer app connecting while the overlay is off never forces it on.
///
/// The scheduler is deliberately platform-agnostic and takes only a controller
/// and an `isEnabled` closure so it can be unit-tested without a real window;
/// `reassert()` is a no-op on the controllers whose overlay isn't a
/// re-stackable system window.
