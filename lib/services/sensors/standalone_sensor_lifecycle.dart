/// Sequences a standalone emulator's attach/start and stop/detach.
///
/// `DirconEmulator.startServer` advertises whatever is already attached to
/// its composite at the moment it is called. Calling it before the
/// definition is attached leaves the composite with no hostable service —
/// `BluetoothTransporter.start` refuses that outright with a `StateError`
/// ("refusing to start an empty peripheral") precisely to avoid the
/// alternative: a cryptic platform-level failure later (Windows rejects an
/// empty advertisement at `startAdvertising`; other transports would just
/// advertise a hollow peripheral). [stop] then [detachDefinition] the same
/// way round for the same reason in reverse: detaching before the transport
/// is stopped can race a live advertisement losing its only service out from
/// under a connected client.
///
/// Pulled out of the inline wiring in `connection.dart` purely so this
/// ordering has a test of its own — `connection.dart` cannot be constructed
/// in a unit test.
