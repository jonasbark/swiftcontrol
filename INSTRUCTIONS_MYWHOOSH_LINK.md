## Instructions for using the MyWhoosh "Link" connection method
*
1) launch MyWhoosh on the device of your choice
2) OPTIONAL: launch MyWhoosh Link, confirm the "Link" connection works at all. **close MyWhoosh Link** - very important! 
3) open BikeControl, follow the on-screen instructions

Once you've confirmed the connection in BikeControl you won't have to do step 2 in the future. This is just to make sure the connection works in general.

And here's a video with a few explanations:

## The MyWhoosh Link app itself works fine, but BikeControl doesn't connect
*
The MyWhoosh Link app must not run simultaneously with BikeControl. Make sure the MyWhoosh Link app is fully closed, then reopen BikeControl and try connecting again.

## MyWhoosh "Link" method never connects
*
The same network restrictions apply for BikeControl as it applies to MyWhoosh Link app. Please verify with the MyWhoosh Link app if a connection is possible at all.

In essence:
- your two devices (phone, tablet) need to be on the same WiFi network
- on iOS you have to turn off "Private Wi-Fi Address" in the WiFi settings
- Limit IP Address Tracking may need to be disabled
- mesh networks may not work
